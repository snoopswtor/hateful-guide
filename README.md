# Hateful Guide [WIP]
By Snoop
*last updated in 7.3.1*

## Introduction
Hi everyone! I go by Snoop, and this is a Hateful guide I'm writing to help people who are interested in either creating a group for Hateful or are progging it. For me, I've helped a few Hateful groups get their kills, as well as led a few of my own. However, I am by no means an expert on this boss, which is why I put this on GitHub; if you think there are any errors or anything I'm missing, feel free to fork this repository, make any changes you want, and then create a pull request. If you do, please tell me on Discord so I can merge them! My username is `.snoop.`

## Getting ready for Hateful

Before you can tackle Hateful, there are a few things that you will need:
* a group of 16 people, consisting of 1 tank, 4 powertechs, 7 dps with self-cleanses, and 4 healers
* a dreadful orb
* everyone (but the tank) to have a mask
* a 2/7 or 7/7 NiM SnV lockout

The first thing is pretty self explanatory -- you want as many DPS as possible to make the dps check easier, as the fight is solo-tankable. Gather these people however you see fit. The next thing, the dreadful orb, is maybe not as obvious.

A dreadful orb is obtained by defeating the secret boss in TFB, which is summoned by defeating a 10-stack dreadtooth. When you kill dreadtooth, he drops something called a *dreadful essence*, which you can apply to dreadtooth (if you have biochem). At 3 stacks, 5 stacks, and 10 stacks, he will get harder and harder. For reference, he starts at one stack. A more full list of mechanics can be found [here on Merlyn's Swtor guides](https://www.merlynswtor.com/operations/other-bosses#h.p_-rwRLliiIUtA). Once the 10-stack is killed (generally with a full group of 24, 3 tanks, and 7 or so healers) you get something called the *Dreadful Amulet*. 

In the 16m HM TFB entrance, around the last staircase before Dread Guards (before going up them), if you run along the outside adjacent to the water, you should come across a cave. When you come across the cave, there should be text that pops up (I forget exactly what it says). As this isn't a dreadful entity guide, I won't delve too much into the mechanics here; however, it is a good fight for people to learn how to position themselves relative to the boss and take dread touches (which will be explained later). It's important to note that the tank will likely get dread touched at some point, so the tank will need a mask. The amulet also goes on cooldown as soon as you use it, so if you don't kill then you will need to pass it to someone else who was in the 10-stack group to summon (assuming it is still on trade cooldown). Once dreadful is killed, he will drop an orb.

While farming masks, it's also recommended to do 3-stack dreadtooths. At 3 stacks, he drops 2 masks and 2 essences, so if you force pvp instance you can get 4 masks from one run without waiting for his 30 minute respawn. Anything over 3 stacks will drop the same number of masks and essences; at 5 he has a chance of dropping the dwedtoof pet, and at 10 stacks he drops the pet and the amulet.

## General mechanics

### Ones on the boss

The boss works by starting with 8 stacks of *Ancient Slumber* and 0 stacks of *Ancient Wrath*. On spawn, he does a cast called *Hateful Awakening*, which reduces his ancient slumber stacks and increase his ancient wrath stacks. Ancient slumber gives the boss 10% DR per stack, while ancient wrath makes the boss take 5% extra damage. So, in theory, by the 6th cast (2 slumber, 6 wrath) the DPS should start dealing more than normal damage. He maxes out at 15 stacks; if he finishes his cast for his 16th stack, the boss kills everyone and does his hard enrage.
