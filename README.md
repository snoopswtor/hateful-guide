## Introduction
Hi everyone! I go by Snoop, and this is a Hateful guide I'm writing to help people who are interested in either creating a group for Hateful or are progging it. For me, I've helped a few Hateful groups get their kills, as well as led a few of my own. However, I am by no means an expert on this boss, which is why I put this on GitHub; if you think there are any errors or anything I'm missing, feel free to fork this repository, make any changes you want, and then create a pull request. If you do, please tell me on Discord so I can merge them! My username is `.snoop.`

## Getting ready for Hateful

Before you can tackle Hateful, there are a few things that you will need:
* a group of 16 people, consisting of 1 tank, 4 powertechs, 7 dps with self-cleanses, and 4 healers
* a dreadful orb
* everyone (but the tank) to have a mask
* a 2/7 or 7/7 NiM SnV lockout

The first thing is pretty self explanatory -- you want as many DPS as possible to make the dps check easier, as the fight is solo-tankable. Gather these people however you see fit. The next thing, the dreadful orb, is maybe not as obvious.

A dreadful orb is obtained by defeating the secret boss in TFB, which is summoned by defeating a 10-stack dreadtooth. When you kill dreadtooth, he drops something called a *dreadful essence*, which you can apply to dreadtooth (if you have biochem). At 3 stacks, 5 stacks, and 10 stacks, he will get harder and harder. For reference, he starts at one stack. A more full list of mechanics can be found [here on Merlyn's Swtor guides](https://www.merlynswtor.com/operations/other-bosses#h.p_-rwRLliiIUtA). Once the 10-stack is killed (generally with a full group of 24, 3 tanks, and 7 or so healers) you get something called the *Dreadful Amulet*. 

In the 16m HM TFB entrance, around the last staircase before Dread Guards (before going up them), if you run along the outside adjacent to the water, you should come across a cave. When you come across the cave, there should be text that pops up (I forget exactly what it says). As this isn't a dreadful entity guide, I won't delve too much into the mechanics here; however, it is a good fight for people to learn how to position themselves relative to the boss and take dread touches (which will be explained later). It's important to note that the tank will likely get dread touched at some point, so the tank will need a mask. The amulet also goes on cooldown as soon as you use it, so if you don't kill then you will need to pass it to someone else who was in the 10-stack group to summon (assuming it is still on trade cooldown). Once dreadful is killed, he will drop an orb.

While farming masks, it's also recommended to do 3-stack dreadtooths. At 3 stacks, he drops 2 masks and 2 essences, so if you force pvp instance you can get 4 masks from one run without waiting for his 30 minute respawn. Anything over 3 stacks will drop the same number of masks and essences; at 5 he has a chance of dropping the dwedtoof pet, and at 10 stacks he drops the pet and the amulet.

## General mechanics

### Ones on the boss

The boss works by starting with 8 stacks of *Ancient Slumber* and 0 stacks of *Ancient Wrath*. On spawn, he does a cast called *Hateful Awakening*, which reduces his ancient slumber stacks and increase his ancient wrath stacks. Ancient slumber gives the boss 10% DR per stack, while ancient wrath makes the boss take 5% extra damage (and deal 5% more damage). So, in theory, by the 6th cast (2 slumber, 6 wrath) the DPS should start dealing more than normal damage. He maxes out at 15 stacks; if he finishes his cast for his 16th stack, the boss kills everyone and does his hard enrage. 

### Ones you need to worry about
* **Death Mark**: Roughly every 60s, starting at around 30s after the boss spawns.
* **Dread Touch**: The reason you need a mask and for rebounders; a knockback that will hit you and apply a debuff. If you don't have a mask when you are hit with this, you will instantly die. The debuff lasts 2:40, and while you have it, you cannot get dread touched. Rebounders help mitigate damage from dread touch. At a certain point in the fight, almost everyone will have the debuff; the person without it will likely get the next knock (e.g. if yours just falls off or if you get rezzed). If yours falls off, you'll want to have a CD or a rebounder ready for it.
* **Grapple**: An ability that goes out every 20s or so (it can be delayed for higher priority abilities, such as Hateful Awakening). Grapples the group to the entity's location. If you have gravity immunity (e.g. through hold the line) it will not affect you. First one will be at 93% on the boss.
* **Hate Pulse**: Massive raidwide AOE that happens every 15s or so.
* **Hateful Void**: big red puddles that you want to try avoid standing in or getting knocked into (e.g. via dread touch). Sometimes you may get grappled into a void, in which case you want to pop some DCD and get out as soon as you can. Goes out ~every 10s.
* **Death Marks**: 8 death marks go out after the cast in progresive order (i.e. you don't get it as soon as the cast finishes). Typically, the powertechs (or anyone without cleanse) is guaranteed to get it, followed by people like maras/juggs/sins, then people who have a faster cleanse. Tanks should not get death marks unless people are dead. They work the same way as they do in Dread Council.

### Prepping the room
First, assign each healer to get a powertech's cleanse, and establish a rebounder order. This is usually done in order of the frame every 15 seconds, so first will rebounder on x:00, next will rebounder on x:15, and so on.

In the actual room, you will kill every group of trash until you get to the stairs leading up to where he spawns. There should be 5 adds; get them all down to 50%, and then single target/basic attack them until they get down to sub 20%. Once they're all sub 20, the entity should consume them and spawn something in its place. **Note the adds need to die inside the room**. To summon, you click on the entity (it's friendly!) and click on the orb. Be careful of any sorcs who may be bubbling people

If you mess up that trash pack, you get the one right before the sarlacc pit (not the ones on the diving board, but the animals and such still), bring them to the room and do the same thing. You can clear the trash around the sarlacc pit if you feel like it.

## The Fight
### Summoning and the initial stages of the fights

As mentioned earlier, to summon the boss, the person with the orb clicks on the "Hateful Presence" and then uses the orb. The presence will become angry **(but is not the actual boss)**, and start hurting the person who summoned, so make sure to heal them. Two notes here: if you use the orb on someone else, the orb will go on cooldown. If you use the orb and you die, the orb goes on cooldown. During this portion, you can get stacks (e.g. build annihilate stacks). After 15 seconds of "Consuming Hatred," there will be a period of 10 seconds without anything before the boss actually spawns. During this time, you can also do whatever is needed (e.g. build supercharge stacks)

Once the boss spawns, everyone should be in the corner to avoid getting flung out of the room with dread touch. Tank will drop three puddles in corners of the room, and death marks will typically happen. From what I've been told, the ideal first grapple timing will be after 3rd puddle but before death marks. After third puddle, everyone (except those with gravity immunity, e.g. powertechs with hydros) should start getting out of the room and down the stairs. Death marks will usually occur around this time, so healers will need to make sure they don't outrange or get LOSed by their powertechs.

Nowadays, tanks should not put fourth puddle behind the rock by the skeleton, but to the right of the stairs (between the stairs and the pillar). Rebounders may need to be delayed until boss is settled so everyone gets it. From here one, the tank should continue putting puddles along the wall, making sure to walk the boss forward and then backward so that puddles are behind the boss. DPS/heals should be ahead of the boss (kind of at a diagonal) and with their backs facing an area without puddles, assuming you haven't gotten dread touched yet. There should be another death mark toward the end of this section. Once the tank starts running out of space, be wary of when a grapple is. When there's a grapple and a puddle, call for predation/transcendence and run down the tunnel with whatever movement abilities are available (for the tank). LOS the boss and put a puddle on the other side of the entrance, and then start going along the wall.

### First tunnel and going back into the room

Once everyone is in place, you will want to raid buff. Again, the PT may want to delay rebounders so everyone is grouped, but by this point most people should be dread touched and know if they need rebounders. Everyone should be, again, ahead of the boss with their back against the other side of the tunnel so they don't get knocked outside or into a previous void. If tank tells you to get out of the room becaue they're placing the last puddle, then **get out of the room**.

Puddle placements may vary from tank to tank at this stage, but again as a DPS/Heal it's always important to be ahead of the boss with your back against the wall without any puddles/voids. For the tank, don't get too greedy with puddles, especially if DPS are pumping/all alive. Place puddles in free spaces rather than next to where puddles may exist or in hard to navigate spaces, as a bad grapple could cause people to fly into them and have trouble getting out. For example, you can probably put puddles on either side of the stairs, but putting two on the right side of the stairs could get dicey. However, as the tank gets more familiar with the fight and how grapples affect people, they can decide how tightly they need to place puddles.

Starting at this point, boss's stacks will start going up, so if someone's dread touch debuff falls off, it will be on them to make sure they have a rebounder or pop some large DCD, as it will hurt otherwise.

When entering first tunnel, boss should ideally be <80%, and when exiting boss should be <64%. When entering second tunnel, boss should be approaching <40% (assuming ~9 stacks). This may vary based on kiting path, though.

### Second tunnel

Main thing to note in this hallway: **be extremely conscious of where you're moving/where you're stepping**. The tunnel has some treacherous spots that make it hard to run up, and you can get caught in a puddle if you're not careful. For this part, you will start noticing how much the boss hurts, so pop AOE DR on cooldown, healers make sure to have AOE healing abilities for hate pulses. Since he's at 9-10+ stacks at this point, he will be doing 40-50% more damage than before. 

Same principles apply though; continue going ahead of the boss and tank should kite 2 steps forward and one step back. Raid buffs should come off cooldown at some point between the middle of this second tunnel and the last room (the one right after Titan 6), so pop them whenever they're back up. When the tank tells you to get out of the room because it's the last puddle, get out.

### Final stage
When exiting the tunnel, boss should be at ~22% or less and at ~12-13 stacks. Tank should be careful kiting the boss around the shrubs (i.e. don't greed too much). Kite along the wall, and people should again try to stay ahead. If people are dead/dps is lower, the tank may need to kite around the gate and back along the wall. If this happens, still stand in front of the boss, tank may just need to kite along the wall. Just make sure your back, again, is not facing any puddles. Keep going along the wall as far as possible, either until kill, wipe or enrage.

## General Notes
### Tanking
* **Lingering shock** is a debuff that the tank gets. It stacks up to 20 times, and increases the amount of damage you take from the boss's autos. To destack, wait until it's around halfway or under from going away, and pop M/R mitigation. This may be deflection, fuel, or saber ward. You can typically do this when kiting for 4th tunnel, around the end of the first tunnel, and in the middle of the second tunnel.
* **Gaining threat in the beginning**: be wary of powertechs and healers in the beginning, as they can pull off of you. Make sure to use as many threat generating abilities (probably 3 or 4) before your first taunt, and then wait for your next taunt. I typically do my first taunt 4 or 5 GCDs in, then wait 7-9s for my second, another 7-8s for my third, and then as I'm running down the stairs I can get my fourth taunt in. It's typically okay if boss swaps off of you for a second or two between taunts, as long as you get them back quickly.
* **When kiting the boss, always** go "two steps forward and one step back." What this means is you move forward, and then move backward so the boss is in front of you and you are behind. This is so void placements are behind the group.
* **Tracking grapple**: I'm not sure if it's doable as a PT or a Jugg, but as a sin I typically save force speed for each grapple (i.e. use it after I get grappled to try to put a void in a better spot). If a void goes down, I can check my force speed (if it's on CD) to see if there's about to be a grapple.

I'm sure there's more stuff to be added, so if you have other suggestions not included here, feel free to DM me on Discord!

### DPSing
I'm not too sure how much there is to say here other than:
* Stay ahead of the boss
* Don't use a cleanse as a DCD
* Get a rebounder if you know you're about to get dread touched. If not, then pop a large DCD
* Use AOE DR

If you're a powertech, you can refresh stacks by moving into a puddle and moving out as soon as it refreshes, ideally with AOE DR. Ranged can stay further ahead if they don't need rebounders, too, as they have less risk of getting grappled into a void if the timing is bad, from what I know.

### Healing
* Remember to cleanse your powertech
* Especially as the boss's stacks start going up and you know a hate pulse is coming up in the next few seconds, make sure you have an AOE heal that you can use to get people healthier. A big hate pulse into grapple + void could be deadly.
* When rezzing people, tell them if it's safe; essentially, ask them to wait for a hate pulse if you think one's coming, as it can instantly kill them again.
* When rezzing people, also warn them that they will need a rebounder or a strong dcd for dread touch.\
* Prioritize rezzes for powertechs
