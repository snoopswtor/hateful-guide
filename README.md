# Hateful Guide [WIP]
By Snoop
*last updated in 7.3.1*

## Introduction
Hi everyone! I go by Snoop, and this is a Hateful guide I'm writing to help people who are interested in either creating a group for Hateful or are progging it. For me, I've helped a few Hateful groups get their kills, as well as led a few of my own. However, I am by no means an expert on this boss, which is why I put this on GitHub; if you think there are any errors or anything I'm missing, feel free to fork this repository, make any changes you want, and then create a pull request. If you do, please tell me on Discord so I can merge them! My username is `.snoop.`
