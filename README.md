# Hateful Guide [WIP]
By Snoop
*last updated in 7.3.1*

## Introduction
Hi everyone! I go by Snoop, and this is a Hateful guide I'm writing to help people who are interested in either creating a group for Hateful or are progging it. For me, I've helped a few Hateful groups get their kills, as well as led a few of my own. However, I am by no means an expert on this boss, which is why I put this on GitHub; if you think there are any errors or anything I'm missing, feel free to fork this repository, make any changes you want, and then create a pull request. If you do, please tell me on Discord so I can merge them! My username is `.snoop.`

## Getting ready for Hateful

Before you can tackle Hateful, there are a few things that you will need:
* a group of 16 people, consisting of 1 tank, 4 powertechs, 7 dps with self-cleanses, and 4 healers
* a dreadful orb
* everyone (but the tank) to have a mask
* a 2/7 or 7/7 NiM SnV lockout

The first thing is pretty self explanatory -- you want as many DPS as possible to make the dps check easier, as the fight is solo-tankable. Gather these people however you see fit. The next thing, the dreadful orb, is maybe not as obvious.

A dreadful orb is obtained by defeating the secret boss in TFB, which is summoned by defeating a 10-stack dreadtooth. When you kill dreadtooth, he drops something called a *dreadful essence*, which you can apply to dreadtooth (if you have biochem). At 3 stacks, 5 stacks, and 10 stacks, he will get harder and harder. For reference, he starts at one stack. A more full list of mechanics can be found [here on Merlyn's Swtor guides](https://www.merlynswtor.com/operations/other-bosses#h.p_-rwRLliiIUtA). Once the 10-stack is killed (generally with a full group of 24, 3 tanks, and 7 or so healers) you get something called the *Dreadful Amulet*. 

In the 16m HM TFB entrance, around the last staircase before Dread Guards (before going up them), if you run along the outside adjacent to the water, you should come across a cave. When you come across the cave, there should be text that pops up (I forget exactly what it says). As this isn't a dreadful entity guide, I won't delve too much into the mechanics here; however, it is a good fight for people to learn how to position themselves relative to the boss and take dread touches (which will be explained later). It's important to note that the tank will likely get dread touched at some point, so the tank will need a mask. The amulet also goes on cooldown as soon as you use it, so if you don't kill then you will need to pass it to someone else who was in the 10-stack group to summon (assuming it is still on trade cooldown). Once dreadful is killed, he will drop an orb.

While farming masks, it's also recommended to do 3-stack dreadtooths. At 3 stacks, he drops 2 masks and 2 essences, so if you force pvp instance you can get 4 masks from one run without waiting for his 30 minute respawn. Anything over 3 stacks will drop the same number of masks and essences; at 5 he has a chance of dropping the dwedtoof pet, and at 10 stacks he drops the pet and the amulet.

## General mechanics

### Ones on the boss

The boss works by starting with 8 stacks of *Ancient Slumber* and 0 stacks of *Ancient Wrath*. On spawn, he does a cast called *Hateful Awakening*, which reduces his ancient slumber stacks and increase his ancient wrath stacks. Ancient slumber gives the boss 10% DR per stack, while ancient wrath makes the boss take 5% extra damage (and deal 5% more damage). So, in theory, by the 6th cast (2 slumber, 6 wrath) the DPS should start dealing more than normal damage. He maxes out at 15 stacks; if he finishes his cast for his 16th stack, the boss kills everyone and does his hard enrage. 

### Ones you need to worry about
* **Death Mark**: Roughly every 60s, starting at around 30s after the boss spawns.
* **Dread Touch**: The reason you need a mask and for rebounders; a knockback that will hit you and apply a debuff. If you don't have a mask when you are hit with this, you will instantly die. The debuff lasts 2:40, and while you have it, you cannot get dread touched. Rebounders help mitigate damage from dread touch.
* **Grapple**: An ability that goes out every 20s or so (it can be delayed for higher priority abilities, such as Hateful Awakening). Grapples the group to the entity's location. If you have gravity immunity (e.g. through hold the line) it will not affect you
* **Hate Pulse**: Massive raidwide AOE that happens every 15s or so.
* **Hateful Void**: big red puddles that you want to try avoid standing in or getting knocked into (e.g. via dread touch). Sometimes you may get grappled into a void, in which case you want to pop some DCD and get out as soon as you can.
* **Death Marks**: 8 death marks go out after the cast in progresive order (i.e. you don't get it as soon as the cast finishes). Typically, the powertechs (or anyone without cleanse) is guaranteed to get it, followed by people like maras/juggs/sins, then people who have a faster cleanse. Tanks should not get death marks unless people are dead. They work the same way as they do in Dread Council.

### Prepping the room
First, assign each healer to get a powertech's cleanse, and establish a rebounder order. This is usually done in order of the frame every 15 seconds, so first will rebounder on x:00, next will rebounder on x:15, and so on.

In the actual room, you will kill every group of trash until you get to the stairs leading up to where he spawns. There should be 5 adds; get them all down to 50%, and then single target/basic attack them until they get down to sub 20%. Once they're all sub 20, the entity should consume them and spawn something in its place. **Note the adds need to die inside the room**. To summon, you click on the entity (it's friendly!) and click on the orb. Be careful of any sorcs who may be bubbling people

If you mess up that trash pack, you get the one right before the sarlacc pit (not the ones on the diving board, but the animals and such still), bring them to the room and do the same thing. You can clear the trash around the sarlacc pit if you feel like it.
